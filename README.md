COURSE:- Python for Financial Analysis and Algorithmic Trading
PLATFORM :- UDEMY

I just showing my work and what I learned. Everything is provided by THE PIERIAN DATA 2017. I own nothing here.

Access path is:- Question Notebook/New Stock Market Analysis Project. My main work is here.

I am taking a course on Udemy(hlaf finished) but it is bit old and some libraries and code has been removed and deprecated, so I did  this exercise in some different way. 
I use some out of syllabus stuff(which I haven't leaned in the course) such as Yahoo Finance(yfinance), seaborn, other things as well.
I used data from 2012 to 2024, it was a lot of data.

**My Comments on the Course**
it is a great course a well organized actually, but I highly like to see update version as so many stuff is deprecated. From this I learned to re-search on my own and got to know so many new things.
